# Lexxy

A modern rich text editor for Rails.

**[Try it out!](https://basecamp.github.io/lexxy/try-it)**

## Features

- Built on top of [Lexical](https://lexical.dev), the powerful text editor framework from Meta.
- Good HTML semantics. Paragraphs are real `<p>` tags, as they should be.
- Markdown support: shortcuts, auto-formatting on paste.
- Real-time code syntax highlighting.
- Create links by pasting URLs on selected text.
- Configurable prompts. Support for mentions and other interactive prompts with multiple loading and filtering strategies.
- Preview attachments like PDFs and Videos in the editor.
- Works seamlessly with Action Text, generating the same canonical HTML format it expects for attachments.
